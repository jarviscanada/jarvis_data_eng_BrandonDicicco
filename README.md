# Brandon DiCicco . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering Science degree in Software Engineering from Western University. Currently, I am employed as a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I learn industry-trending and standard technologies and implement applications with a real-world purpose. I'm also able to apply technical knowledge daily in various domains such as Java, SQL, Linux, and more. Throughout my schooling, I learned and used various languages and frameworks such as Java, C#, web technologies, RDBMS, and Git. I've developed full-stack web applications with REST APIs along with desktop applications. Throughout my schooling and career history, I've worked in many fast-paced and collaborative teams. These teams required me to continuously learn and be responsible for my work. I currently have a passion for the insights data can provide, and I am interested in applying creative solutions to real-world problems.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonDicicco](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonDicicco)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonDicicco/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring agent tool for internal use. Utilized Bash scripts along with SQL queries to collect hardware information continuously using crontab. Stored collected information in a dockerized PostgreSQL database. Developed sample queries that demonstrate the possible data analytics available through the collected information. Fully developed and tested the application using a CentOS 7 virtual machine running on the Google Cloud Platform.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BrandonDicicco/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: Developed an application that utilizes the JDBC API to connect between Java code and a PostgreSQL database instance deployed using Docker. Implemented CRUD operations for various data access objects (DAOs) that work on pre-defined SQL queries.
  - Grep App: Created a Java application that recreates a simplified version of the Linux grep command. The program recursively searches through a directory to find all user-specified Regex matches and outputs to a file. Utilized lambda functions and streams in order to reduce memory usage and optimize performance. Built and compiled using Maven, along with being deployed on Docker Hub.


## Highlighted Projects
**Self Start Body Smart - Online Physiotherapy Service**: Developed in an Agile team a full-stack online physiotherapy application for a client. Created various documentation such as UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and the software requirements specification (SRS). Communicated regularly with project supervisors and the client to implement continuous feedback and requirement changes. Developed the application using the MEEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Ember, Node.js). Helped in the creation of a REST API for server-side routing. Personal focus on dynamic forms and questions, graphs, video APIs, payment APIs, and more. Received a prize for being selected as a top 3 group.

**Aipen - Automated Machine Learning Framework** [[GitHub](https://github.com/bcdicicco/Aipen)]: Developed in an Agile team an evolutionary engine automated machine learning framework with the target audience of machine learning researchers. Created various documents such as project proposal, requirements, design document, and user manual. The project used Python with Flask for the backend and JavaScript/HTML/CSS for the frontend. Personal focus on the frontend to retrieve and display data from the AutoML instance. Created backend data routing.
