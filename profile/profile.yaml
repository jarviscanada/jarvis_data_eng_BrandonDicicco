summary: "I graduated with a Bachelor's of Engineering Science in Software Engineering from Western University. Currently, I am employed as a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting where I learn industry-trending and standard technologies, and implement applications with real-world purpose. I'm able to apply technical knowledge daily in various domains such as Java, SQL, Linux, and more. Throughout my schooling, I learned and used various languages and frameworks such as Java, C#, web technologies, RDBMS, and Git. I've developed full-stack web applications with REST APIs along with desktop applications. Throughout my schooling and career history, I've worked in many fast-paced highly collaborative teams that required me to always be learning and be responsible. I currently have a passion for the insights data can provide, and I am interested in applying creative solutions to real-world problems."
